# Langchain-Project-19009
This is a Streamlit-based FAQ chatbot for SIWS College. It uses LangChain with HuggingFace embeddings to understand user queries about courses, fees, admissions, facilities, placements, and campus life. Users type questions, and the bot retrieves relevant answers from a prebuilt knowledge base with a natural, conversational response.
